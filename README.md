# AI Projects

This repository contains some of my old personal projects in Machine Learning. 

I have updated the notebooks to reflect current implementation changes as well as some optimizations. Finally, I have formatted them as learning notebooks for those interested in using them for learning. 

The `data` folder contains all the data by day index. Each notebook has an index in order to numerically categorize them and their progression.

Enjoy!
